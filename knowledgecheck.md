\*Hello, \*world\*!\*

\*\*Hello, \*world\*!\*\*

\*\*\*Hello, world!\*\*\*

***Hello, world!***
**bold** is produced with two asterix on either side of the word and *italics* with one on each side. You can also use underscores (_) instead of asterisks if you prefer.

\#\#\# Hello, world!

## How do you print certain characters, like asterisks (*) and underscores (_), literally on your output? 

Use three in a row, like *** or ___.

**Escape them with a backslash, like \* or \_.**
You can also escape other reserved characters, including { and #, using backslashes.

Unfortunately, this isn't supported at this time.

## Suppose there's an HTML snippet that you want to include on your GitHub Pages web site, but Markdown doesn't offer a way to render it. What should you do? 

**Just add the HTML inline.**
Markdown isn't a complete replacement for HTML. You might need to add HTML to get the final results you're looking for.

Cut the content. If it's not supported in Markdown, then it's probably not worth including.

Open an issue that requests Markdown support for your specialized scenario.

## What is not a good reason to create a pull request? 

You would like to receive feedback on prospective changes before merging your feature branch into main.

You want to merge your bug fix branch into main, but don't have permission.

**Your branch can't be merged into main due to upstream changes made since you created it. Creating a pull request lets the other contributor know they need to pull their changes out so you can put yours in.**
Pull requests don't work this way. Also, the etiquette is for you to be sure your branch can be cleanly merged into the base before creating a pull request.


## How can you ensure that pull requests for a given area of the repository, aren't merged unless certain users or teams approve? 

Clearly explain the pull request policy in CONTRIBUTING.md.

**Use a CODEOWNERS file and enable required reviews.**
A CODEOWNERS file enables you to assign users or teams as required reviewers using the same syntax as .gitignore files.


Add a table that maps directory paths to required users in SECURITY.md.

## You're requested to review a pull request. As you read through it, you notice several minor coding errors and typos. How should you handle the review? 

**Start a review and fix obvious typos inline. Add comments in places that require further discussion or offer educational value. Complete the review with changes requested.**
Contributors always appreciate when reviewers show an interest in getting their code merged.

Leave single comments for each issue you come across, but don't change the code. For typos, include the correct spelling of the word as a reference. Approve the pull request if you trust the author to implement your suggestions.

Reject the pull request. We can't risk any bugs accidentally being merged into an important branch.

## How does GitHub's top-level search bar differ from the search options available on repository tabs? 

Other than being located in different parts of the user interface, they are otherwise the same.

They support different filter syntax options.

**The top-level search bar supports searching everything across all of GitHub, whereas the repository tab searches are scoped to cover specific types in the current repository.**
The top-level search allows the most flexibility, whereas the scoped tab searches provide popular filter dropdowns for easier refinement.

## What does git blame do? 

It creates a bug assigned to the last person who committed changes to the specified file.

**It displays the commit history of the file.**
Despite the accusatory name, git blame is just a command to display commit history.

It reverts the effects of a git praise command.

## Suppose a bug issue is reported on your project, and you know which pull request introduced the problem. Which of the following options is not a cross-linking best practice? 

**Do not create cross-links when the root cause of the issue is already known.**
It's a good practice to always add cross-links in case you or someone else needs the context later on.

Add a comment to the bug report that includes the pull request's author by using an @mention.

Add a comment to the bug report that links the pull request to it using the #ID syntax.

## How does GitHub Copilot work? 

**GitHub Copilot uses prompts and natural language text that you type to provide coding suggestions.**
GitHub Copilot is trained on billions of lines of code. It turns natural language prompts into coding suggestions across dozens of languages.

GitHub Copilot uses lights, that you type, and it provides suggestions based on what you type.

GitHub Copilot uses radio language, that you type, and it provides suggestions based on what you type.

## What are some GitHub Copilot Free features? 

It's a free unrestrticted AI tool that works independent of code editors.

**It provides several suggestions and chats per month directly in your IDE and on github.com.**
 It also supports multi-file editing and and switching models!

An option to enable slower responses, preservering your Copilot Pro quota.

## How can you accept GitHub Copilot's suggestions? 

**Press the Tab key.**
Copilot offers you a suggestion, which appears as grey code if you use black as your text color. To accept the suggestion, you need to press the Tab key.

Press the F1 key.

Press the F4 key.

## Identify which statement is valid and select the correct answer: 

A prompt, which is our output, is a collection of songs that tells our copilot what to generate.

**A prompt, which is our input, is a collection of instructions or guidelines that tell our copilot what to generate.**
A prompt is crucial in eliciting specific responses from Copilot. The prompt might be a comment that steers Copilot to generate code on your behalf or writing code that Copilot autocompletes.

A prompt, which is our document, is a collection of laptops that tells our Copilot what to generate.

## What does the quality of the output from GitHub Copilot depend on? 

Your code editor.

How well your extensions were installed.

**How well you crafted your prompt.**
Designing an effective prompt is, therefore, crucial in ensuring we achieve our desired outcomes. You need to detail your prompt as much as possible.

## What is one of the main benefits for using a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of a standard username and password for GitHub authentication?

**PAT can be used for authentication to GitHub when using the GitHub API or the command line. Users generate a token via the GitHub's settings option, and tie the token permissions to a repository or organization.**

PAT lets you authenticate GitHub Enterprise Server against your existing accounts and centrally manage repository access.

PATs can be managed by the organization and enterprise.

PAT is an extra layer of security used when logging into websites or apps. With PAT, users have to sign in with their username and password and provide another form of authentication that only they have access to.

## How does the synchronization between GitHub projects, issues and pull requests work?

Information synchronization only works in one direction - from issues and pull requests to projects. Updates to Project items won't be automatically mirrored in issues and pull requests.

Information synchronization only works in one direction - from project to issues and pull requests. Updates to issues and pull requests won't be automatically mirrored in GitHub Project items.

Updates to the issues and pull requests will not be automatically reflected in GitHub Projects, it has to be triggered manually by the user.

**Updates to the issues and pull requests will be automatically reflected in GitHub Projects. This integration works both ways, so that when you change information about a pull request or issue in your project, the pull request or issue reflects that information.**
